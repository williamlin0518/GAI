# Combining DIP and DDPM for Image Generation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Deep Image Prior (DIP) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) techniques. The goal is to show improvements in either image quality, generation speed, or both, compared to using DDPM or DIP individually. This README will guide you through understanding the theoretical justifications, setting up the environment, running the code, and reproducing the experiments.

## Theoretical Justifications
1. **Deep Image Prior (DIP)**:
   - DIP uses a randomly initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the statistics of a single image.
   - The network is trained to map a noise vector to the target image, iteratively refining the generated image without any pretraining on a large dataset.
   - It leverages the structure of the neural network to naturally encode the low-level statistics of the image, thereby serving as a strong prior.

2. **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**:
   - DDPMs are generative models that gradually denoise a sample from a Gaussian distribution to produce a realistic image.
   - They involve a forward process that adds noise to the data and a reverse process that learns to remove the noise, thus generating the image.
   - By combining the DIP with DDPM, we initialize the DDPM with a refined image from DIP, which helps in speeding up the denoising process and potentially improving the final image quality.
